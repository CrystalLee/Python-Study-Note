# Learning Map

Here is a note for myself to record the topics I'm going to study in terms of python coding skill , Advanced analytics skills as well as Machine Learning


## Basic Knowledge (before study group)
- Data cleaning and Preparation
- Data Analysis and Exploration
- Visualization and application (purpose, story, details)
- Statistical Knowledge

## Python for Beginners (Data Analytic)
- 基本語法
- Pandas (表格處理)
- Numpy (數字計算處理)
- Plotly (visualization)

## Applications
- Web Scraping
- Network Analysis
- NLP
> 1.  Jieba + TFIDF
> 2.  LDA
-  Time series Forecast & seasonality & business trend
> 1. ARIMA
> 2. Prophet
- Recommendation :
> 1. Word2Vec
> 2. fp growth
> 3. Collaborative Filtering
> 4. Association Rules

## Machine Learning for Beginners
- What’s the difference between : Supervised Regression / Supervised Classification / Unsupervised Clustering
- Steps of Machine Learning

## Supervised Regression
- Markov Chain
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- XGBoost
## Supervised Classification
- Decision Tree & Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine
- K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN)

## Unsupervised Clustering
- K-Means
- Hierarchical clustering
- Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

## Feature Engineering
- Normalization / Standardization
- Dealing with missing value / imputation
- Imbalanced data handling : SMOTE
- Dimensionality Reduction :  PCA
- Validation : Accuracy / AUC / Recall / Precision / F1

## Advanced machine learning
- Neural Network
- CNN
- RNN
- Deep Learning
